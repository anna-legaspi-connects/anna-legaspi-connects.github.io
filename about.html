        <h2>My Story</h2>

<p><strong>Hi, I’m Anna Legaspi.</strong> I make art that helps people feel they belong and they matter.</p>

<p>One of my earliest memories, maybe when I was about four years old, is sitting on the bed staring at my mum's drawing of a perfect smiley face on a yellow Post-it. In my young eyes, that smiley face was perfection. I tried to copy it over and over, but mine were always wobbly and wonky. Eventually, I asked mum, “How do you do it so well?” She just smiled and said, “You just keep drawing.”</p>

<p><strong>And I did. I never really stopped.</strong></p>

        <hr />

<p>All through my childhood and high school years in the Philippines, art was a constant. I have vivid memories of drawing and painting with my friends, whilst simultaneously eating ALL the sweets. There was this bond of friendship and rivalry. I appreciated their work with deep respect and idolisation. I won’t lie, sometimes I was jealous. I had a few friends whose work made me think, "Damn, I want to be that good." It motivated me. It pushed me to keep improving, to keep showing up, to find my own craft.</p>

<p>In my early years, art wasn't just an activity. I was in a small group of friends who were grounded and connected through art, and I felt that I belonged.</p>

<p class="image-caption">Me and my art crew at 16 — rocker vibes, Ranma sketches, Sailor Moon swaps, and PowerPoint masterpieces. I may look half-asleep, but these girls lit up my creative world.</p>


        <hr />

<p>When I moved to the UK at 17, I carried that creativity across continents. I chose A-level Art without question since it was the only thing that made sense. I didn’t have my old friends anymore. I was homesick, lonely, and tried to find my footing in an unfamiliar country and culture. I was desperate for authentic connection, and I struggled. My sketchbooks from that time were full of isolation and sadness, but it helped me feel anchored while everything else felt foreign. I held on to that early promise: just keep drawing.</p>

        <hr />

<p><strong>But life doesn’t always give you space to create. Sometimes, it demands you survive instead.</strong><br />    
At 21, my mum became seriously ill with kidney failure. She had to return to the Philippines to get a kidney transplant. My mum was the only adult I could rely on at the time and she had to leave. It wasn't her fault at all, but suddenly, it was just me and my younger sister here in the UK. We had no extended family. No safety net.</p>

<p class="image-caption">Neo prints from before everything changed. We were loud, silly, inseparable. Suddenly it was just us — and we had to grow up fast.</p>

<p>I was forced to become the adult. I worked, paid all the bills and took on the debts. I told my sister to focus on school and not worry about money. We both did what we needed to do to survive. This experience turned me into a different person. I found a stronger side of me, but at the expense of losing other parts of my life. During that time, creativity felt like a luxury I couldn’t afford. I carried this new person with me for a very long time.</p>

        <hr />

<p><strong>That said, I never completely stopped.</strong> Over the years, I found myself coming back to art in waves. There were brief periods where I found myself reconnecting to my younger self. It was never consistent, but the desire to be creative was always there. The logical part of my brain was saying I needed security and art wasn't a priority, it's a luxury.</p>

<p class="image-caption">Pieces from those in-between moments — each one part of a slow, uncertain return to myself.</p>


        <hr />

<p>Then, a few months ago, came <strong>my own diagnosis: stage IV kidney failure.</strong> I’d known it was coming since I inherited this disease from my mum. I was told I had two years before needing dialysis or a transplant. This brought back all the memories of what happened in the past. The fear of what will happen to my future and I was suddenly face-to-face with the looming weight of my own mortality. It felt like everything stopped. I am anxious about what will happen and equally grieving about the things I hadn’t yet done and may not be able to do.</p>

        <img src="images/death.png" alt="Quote by Marcus Aurelius: It is not death that man should fear, but he should fear never beginning to live." class="inserted-image full-width-image" />
<p class="image-caption">This marked the beginning of something new.</p>

<p>And then I asked myself the hard question: <strong>If I was going to die soon, what would I want to do?</strong></p>

<p>The answer was clear: <strong>I want to create. I want to connect. I want to live with meaning.</strong></p>

        <hr />

<p>Through that reckoning, I returned to art—but this time with purpose. I attended a course that allowed me to inquire who I really was underneath everything I’d carried. And I found the words I’d been circling for years:</p>

<p><strong>My purpose is to heal relationships and create authentic connections.</strong></p>

<p>That purpose now runs through everything I make. My art isn’t just about aesthetics or style, it’s about people. At the heart of it is everybody. My family and friends, the connections I've made in life, the stranger walking down the street, every single person. It's about the invisible golden thread that connects us to all living beings.</p>

        <img src="images/xmas.jpg" alt="Anna with her mum and sister, smiling with reindeer headbands at Christmas" class="inserted-image full-width-image" />
<p class="image-caption">This is my golden thread — it extends to my loved ones, and to you too.</p>

<p>I don’t know exactly what the future holds for my health and I'm still in the process of accepting this. What I do know is that I’m here now. I’m creating work that nourishes me. I’m building spaces where others can feel a little less alone. And I’m shaping a body of work that quietly says: <strong>you belong. you matter.</strong></p>

<p><em>If you’ve made it this far — thank you for walking this journey with me.  
We’re all tangled in this together, in this invisible golden thread of connection.
Anna - April 2025</em></p>
